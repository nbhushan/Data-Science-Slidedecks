# Data Lab 3: Creative Brief

Write a Python function to estimate the coefficients of a linear regression model using the normal equations.

&beta; = (X<sup>T</sup>X)<sup>-1</sup>X<sup>T</sup>Y

Where,

&beta; (beta) : vector of regression coefficients <br>
X : matrix of predictor variables. <br>
Y : vector of the outcome variable. <br>


Specifically, create a Python function ```LinReg``` which can solve for the coefficients of
a linear regression model using the normal equations.

```python
def LinReg(X, y):
    beta = <insert normal equations here>
    return(beta)
```

> hint: Use the function created above to solve the normal equations for linear regression and verify your solution with the standard implementation in scikit-learn

> hint: how would you include the intercept (or bias) in the beta matrix?

## Deliverable(s)

The Jupyter notebooks or .py scripts are to be uploaded to Github no later than 5pm on last data lab day. Confer with a lecturer beforehand if you're handing in something other than Jupyter notebook or .py scripts.
