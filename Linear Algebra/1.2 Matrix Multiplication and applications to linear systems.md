# Matrix Multiplication and inversion
One of the most important operations involving matrices is multiplication of two
matrices.
There are two main ways to compute the product of two matrices and you will learn
 about them today. Next you will learn about how to compute the inverse of a matrix,
 and lastly on Wednesday, you will learn how you can apply the concepts learned so far to solve for a
 system of linear equations.


## Today's learning objectives
- [ ] Understand how to compute element wise product between matrices.
- [ ] Understand how to compute a dot product between matrices.
- [ ] Understand how to invert a matrix.


## Matrix multiplication
The matrix product of matrices **A** and **B** is a third matrix **C**.
A key condition that has to be satisfied before two matrices **A** and **B**
can be multiplied is that A must have the same number of columns as
B has rows. If A is of shape m X n and B is of shape n X p, then C is of shape
m X p.

Matrix multiplication if often denoted by just placing the matrices next to each
other. **C** = **A**.**B**


### Element-wise Multiplication
The simplest form of matrix multiplication is to just multiply the individual entries.
This of course requires the two matrices to be of the same dimensionality (equal number of rows
and columns.). It is often termed as element-wise product or Hadamard product,
and is denoted a circle with a dot in it.

### Dot product
The dot product between two vectors **x** and **y** of the same dimensionality
is the matrix product **x**<sup>T</sup>**y**.

> what does the symbol " <sup>T</sup> " represent?

We can think of the matrix product **C** = **A**.**B** as
computing **C**<sub>i,j</sub> as the dot product between row i of **A** and
column j of **B**.

## Matrix inversion

The matrix inverse of **A** is denoted as **A**<sup>−1</sup>, and it is defined as the matrix
such that **A**<sup>−1</sup>**A** = **I**. Where **I** is the identity matrix.

> Similar to a determinant, at this moment it is more important to understand the
mechanics of how to invert a matrix in contrast to what does matrix inversion
actually achieve. That will again come with experience and practise and kindly be
patient.

> Note that a key condition for a matrix inverse to exist is that the determinant of
a matrix should not be 0

<br>
In practice, you rarely solve for a matrix inverse by hand, typically this is
done using computers. In Python, NumPy provides functions that automatically
compute the inverse of a given matrix - ```numpy.linalg.inv```.

# Assignment

a) Please read until (and including) Section 2.3 of the linear algebra text you can find [here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/linear_algebra.html).

> Note: Do not worry if you find it hard to understand the notation at the moment. That comes with practice and experience.

# Preparation for the DataLab

- [ ]  Bring one object of our preference from your home. You will use this object in tomorrow's workshop on Project Pitching skills with Bert.

## That's it for today!
